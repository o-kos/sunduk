# Sunduk
**Sunduk**, transliteration from russian "Chest"|"Box", is persistent map store, key-value library in Go for
persisting data to disk. This library is inspired by [gdstore](https://github.com/TwiN/gdstore) library.

A typical use case is fast reading of a previously singly generated set of binary data.
